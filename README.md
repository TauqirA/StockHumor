# StockHumor

In a world where stocks and humor are barely related, comes the future of investing. 
Social Investing. In our endevour to imagine tommmorrow, we envisioned the serious buisness of 
stock prices becoming a more social and fun experience. So we have brought humor to making a 
loss or gain in the market and connected it to twitter to start a conversation around a market change.
With curated tweets that are guaranteed to make you laugh (or at least chuckle), stock information becomes not 
only accessible but also relatable.

We view the next generation of investors flocking to the companies they are already loyal to and using this 
tweet generator to either laugh off a loss or show off a win.
